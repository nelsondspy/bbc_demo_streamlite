# Assignment: Enhancing User Feedback Mechanisms in a Streamlit App

### Overview
In this assignment, you will enhance an existing Streamlit application that presents episodes from a series. The application already allows users to select episodes and seasons, and logs these activities as explicit feedback. Your task is to expand the feedback mechanisms by adding both explicit and implicit feedback options. This will involve utilizing various input widgets available in Streamlit to capture user reactions, preferences, and interactions in more depth.

### Objectives
Integrate additional explicit feedback mechanisms to collect detailed user preferences.
Implement implicit feedback features to infer user interests and satisfaction.
Ensure that the feedback is properly logged and can be used for further analysis or recommendation purposes.
